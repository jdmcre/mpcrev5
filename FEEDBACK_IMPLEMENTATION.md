# Merida Partners CRM ‚Äì Feedback Implementation Summary

This document outlines all the improvements made to address the feedback provided for the Merida Partners CRM portal.

## üéØ Issues Addressed

### 1. ‚úÖ Delete Confirmation Modals
**Problem**: Basic `confirm()` dialogs were not user-friendly and lacked proper styling.

**Solution**: 
- Created a reusable `DeleteConfirmationModal` component with proper styling and UX
- Implemented across all pages: Properties, Markets, Clients, and Users
- Added loading states and proper error handling
- Consistent styling with the rest of the application

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/ui/delete-confirmation-modal.tsx` (new)
- `src/components/ui/dialog.tsx` (new)

**Solution**:
- Enhanced `DataService` with new methods to fetch markets with property counts
- Updated markets page to display actual property counts per market

- Replaces complex JSON input with intuitive UI

**Files Modified**:
